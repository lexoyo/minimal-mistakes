## How it works?

Our plans will [check your site as often as once per minute](https://lexoyo.me/monitoshi-website/). You get unlimited email and SMS notifications (the United States, International SMS is available) and we will do our best to tell you why your site is down by providing the HTML code of error state, where is possible. We also provide an iPhone app, RSS feeds, webhooks, keyword search, premium-level support, email notifications to multiple addresses, multiple user accounts, voice calls and more!
