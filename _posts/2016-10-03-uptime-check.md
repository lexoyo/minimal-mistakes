## what is Monitoshi

[Monitoshi monitors the availability of a website](https://lexoyo.me/monitoshi-website/) and also notifies breakdowns. It manages this well because there are many servers from around the world constantly checking if your site is running. It is also good to monitor whether services are in place for a website, it can check a channel on a customized Web page that could hit your database, file manager waiting, etc.

It is not well suited as a way to inform users of failures and the reasons for the failure. It is also not suitable for monitoring the overall health of a server (disk space, CPU utilization, memory usage, etc.).

## Use Cases and scope of deployment

I used [Monitoshi to monitor more than 40 different sites](https://lexoyo.me/monitoshi-website/), all on different servers. The sites had weak points that would ensure that they will be down or slow in certain circumstances.
