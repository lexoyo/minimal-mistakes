Here is [an app to access all your file storage services](http://www.zeropc.com/).

It is just like an operating system in the browser, and the hard drives are your cloud services - dropbox, google drive, skydrive, etc., your social networks and your photo storage services - flickr, picassa, etc.
A virtual desktop to access all your cloud data

The experience is the same as the [oneye virtual desktop](http://oneye-project.org/), but with an access to all the SaaS services you use.
